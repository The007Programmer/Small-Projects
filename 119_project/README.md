# What is this?

As a student in AP Computer Science Principles, one would follow a set of assignments from [PLTW](https://www.pltw.org/curriculum/pltw-computer-science). This is one of the larger projects/assignments, where the programmer was instructed to create an image using the python [turtle module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html), which was representative of a high school in a halloween setting. We had to follow the guidelines of the PLTW document as well as the AP CSP Create Task Guidelines. 

# How to run?

IMPORTANT STEPS:

1. FILE PATH CHANGES
    Not all file paths may work when run, as they are generic file paths, you may need to enter an absolute path (type `pwd` in console to determine path).
    - To ensure speedy path changes, there is a large comment string before each edit-area.
        - Example:
        ```py
        ####################################################################################

        # EDIT THIS FILE PATH

        ####################################################################################
        ```
    - There are 5 paths to edit in the `input.py` file.
    - There are 17 paths to edit in the `artist.py` file.

2. Run the main.py file in any text editor, making sure the filestructure stays the same.
